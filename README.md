# 🐷 Pig Latin Translator

This is a beginner-friendly Python project that translates English sentences into **Pig Latin** – a fun, playful language game often used by children. It's a great way to practice string manipulation, conditionals, and basic I/O in Python.

## 🔤 How Pig Latin Works

- If a word starts with a **vowel** (a, e, i, o, u), add `"way"` to the end.
  - Example: `apple` → `appleway`
- If a word starts with **consonant(s)**, move the consonant(s) to the end of the word and add `"ay"`.
  - Example: `hello` → `ellohay`
  - Example: `string` → `ingstray`

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repo or copy the `main.py` file.
2. Run the script with Python 3:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. Enter a sentence when prompted, and get the Pig Latin translation.

## 🧠 What You'll Learn

- String manipulation
- Working with loops and conditionals
- User input/output in Python
